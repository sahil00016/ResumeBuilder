## üåü About The Project

This isn't just another resume builder. It's an intelligent career assistant powered by the Google Gemini AI. This full-stack application was built to streamline the tedious process of crafting job application materials, allowing users to generate high-quality, professional resumes and cover letters with ease. 

From selecting a template to fine-tuning the AI-generated content with a live preview, every part of the experience is designed to be intuitive, fast, and effective. The standout feature is the **AI-Styled Template**, where the AI acts not just as a writer, but as a designer, structuring the resume content into a visually appealing, professional layout.

## üöÄ Technology Stack & Philosophy

This project was built with a modern, robust, and scalable tech stack, chosen for performance and developer experience.

- **Frontend**: **React (with Vite)** was chosen for its lightning-fast development server and optimized build process. **Tailwind CSS** allows for rapid, utility-first styling.
- **Backend**: **Node.js & Express** provide a lightweight, powerful, and non-blocking foundation for the API.
- **AI Integration**: The **Google Gemini API** was selected for its advanced reasoning and content generation capabilities.
- **Templating & PDF**: **EJS** is used for its simplicity in rendering server-side HTML, which is then converted to a PDF using **Puppeteer** for perfect print-fidelity.
- **Authentication**: **Clerk.dev** handles the entire user authentication flow, providing a secure and seamless sign-in experience out-of-the-box.
